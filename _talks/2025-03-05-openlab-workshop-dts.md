This talk was given on the second day of the [2025 CERN openlab Technical Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1440389/) and showcased my work
on scientific digital twins.

The first example is [itwinai](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/itwinai/), a Python toolkit to support AI-driven digital twins on HPC, developed
in the context of [interTwin](https://intertwin.eu/). interTwin is an EC-funded project focusing on developing a Digital Twins Engine (DTE) for scientific applications, 
with the goal of alleviating the engineering burden on the reresearchers, benefitting the scientific community.

Other examples included the work done with [Nvidia Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) on visual digital twins, and the collaboration with the
Imperial College on AI-driven digital twins for data quality monitoring (DQM) at the [CMS ECAL](https://cms.cern/detector/measuring-energy/energy-electrons-and-photons-ecal)
detector.

The [2025 CERN openlab Technical Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1440389/) is the annual workshop organized by [CERN openlab](https://openlab.cern/)
to showcase the advancements in computing technologies developed by CERN's IT department, either independently or
by collaborating with industry players, such as NVIDIA, Microsoft and Intel.
