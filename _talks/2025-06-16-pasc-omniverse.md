This poster was presented at [PASC25](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/) conference and summarized our
work on [Nvidia Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) targeting interactive visualizations
of physics events generated with [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/).

The original abstract:

> Simulations play a crucial role in high energy, nuclear, and accelerator physics, aiding in both data analysis and hardware development. Over the years, several advanced programs have been created to generate detailed and precise simulated events, providing insights into complex physical processes. While visualizing particle motion provides a powerful means to grasp physical interactions, its widespread adoption has been hindered by high computational demands and the absence of truly interactive tools. This work leverages NVIDIA Omniverse as a platform to enhance simulation via interactive visualizations. Built on the Universal Scene Description (USD) framework, Omniverse provides robust tools for integrating 3D scene composition, animation, and real-time interactivity, enabling new possibilities for dynamic exploration. The project aims to develop a user-friendly interface where users define simulation parameters via Omniverse, with Geant4 powering the simulation in the background. A key innovation is the translation of Geant4 geometries into USD format, which allows users to interact with and modify simulation scenarios in real time within Omniverse. This contribution presents use cases developed with Omniverse and Geant4, illustrating the potential of this approach to enhance interactive visualization in physics simulations while addressing challenges posed by the intricate detector geometries and complex processes of real experiments.
