This talk was given on the first day of the [2024 CERN openlab Technical Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225408/) and concerned the
introduction to [interTwin](), an EC-funded project focusing on developing a Digital Twins Engine (DTE) for scientific applications, 
with the goal of alleviating the engineering burden on the reresearchers, benefitting the scientific community.

The [2023 CERN openlab Technical Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1356148/) is the annual workshop organized by [CERN openlab](https://openlab.cern/)
to showcase the advancements in computing technologies developed by CERN's IT department, either independently or
by collaborating with industry players, such as NVIDIA, Microsoft and Intel.
