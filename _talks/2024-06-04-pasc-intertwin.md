This poster was presented at [PASC24](https://pasc24.pasc-conference.org/) conference, hosted at ETH Zurich, and summarized our
main contributions to the [interTwin](https://www.intertwin.eu/) project in terms of large-scale scientific AI
workflows on EuroHPC resources, to support digital twin applications in Physics and Climate Research.

The original abstract:

> The interTwin project, funded by the European Commission, is at the forefront of leveraging 'Digital Twins' across various scientific domains, with a particular emphasis on earth observation and physics. This initiative encompasses core modules designed to address the intricacies of data-driven and compute-intensive applications. From real-time data acquisition, software quality and Artificial Intelligence (AI), interTwin aims to facilitate seamless communication and interoperability across High Performance Computing (HPC), High Throughput Computing (HTC), and cloud resources for the benefit of physics and earth observation research.
