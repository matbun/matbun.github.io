excerpt: 'As cyberspace becomes more and more complex, malware authors strive to take advantage of the growing number of vulnerabilities. This requires security researchers to invest more effort in developing automated malware analysis tools, able to cope with the increasing pace of suspicious binaries. The Achilles heel of automated malware analysis tools is evasive malware, which may put countless strategies in place to impede analysis. For instance, malware trying to detect that they are under observation in an analysis environment and, as a consequence, conceal their malicious behavior by performing only innocuous operations. Evasive malware can hinder analysis by either performing static code obfuscation (eg via packers, crypters) or dynamic evasion (eg sandbox and debugger evasion). The goal of this thesis is to explore the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamic analysis, to reduce the burden of exhaustive exploration of conditional paths. To this end, we develop a model that is capable of noticing new evasive schemes via RL. Stateof-the-art approaches generally identify evasions through fingerprinting, which is not effective in identifying slight mutations of evasion schemes. In contrast, this work employs a language model to abstract out the syntax of binary code, while preserving its semantics. Furthermore, to improve over state-of-the-art solutions, the presented solution considers both evasion schemes and the malicious nature of regions of code protected by evasive conditions, to better distinguish true evasive behaviors from false positives. As a consequence, this method is easily extended to guide the search of...'
