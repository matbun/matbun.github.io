title: "A software ecosystem for multi-level provenance management in large-scale scientific workflows for AI applications"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-11-prov
excerpt: 'Scientific workflows and provenance are two faces of the same medal. While the former addresses the coordinated execution of multiple tasks over a set of computational resources, the latter relates to the historical record of data from its original sources. This paper highlights the importance of tracking multi-level provenance metadata in complex, AI-based scientific workflows as a way to (i) foster and (ii) expand documentation of experiments, (iii) enable reproducibility, (iv) address interpretability of the results, (v) facilitate performance bottlenecks diagnosis, and (vi) advance provenance exploration and analysis opportunities.'
