I build intelligent systems to solve complex, real-world problems. My focus is on digital twins, artificial intelligence, and the computing infrastructure that powers them (e.g., HPC systems).

I'm currently a Fellow in the [CERN](https://home.cern/) IT Department and collaborate with [CERN openlab](https://openlab-wp.web.cern.ch/), where I lead a task in the [interTwin](https://www.intertwin.eu/) project. Our team is developing [itwinai](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/itwinai), a toolkit for large-scale AI workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

More recently, I've been working with the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) on a digital twin of data centre operations to improve energy efficiency and resource allocation, as part of the [ODISSEE project](https://odissee-project.eu/).

I'm focused on building trustworthy digital twins that strengthen scientific discovery and operations. Long-term, I aim to help research infrastructures adopt DTs as dependable tools for insight, performance, and sustainability.
