I build intelligent systems to solve complex, real-world problems. My focus is on digital twins, artificial intelligence, and the computing infrastructure that powers them (e.g., HPC systems).

I'm currently working in the [Compute & Devices](https://information-technology.web.cern.ch/about/organisation/compute-devices) group of the IT Department at [CERN](https://home.cern/).
Moreover, I am collaborating with the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) on a digital twin of data centre operations to improve energy efficiency and resource allocation, as part of the [ODISSEE project](https://odissee-project.eu/).

Previously, I worked in the [interTwin](https://www.intertwin.eu/) project, where my team and I is develped [itwinai](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/itwinai), a toolkit for large-scale AI workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

I'm focused on building trustworthy digital twins that strengthen scientific discovery and operations. Long-term, I aim to help research infrastructures adopt DTs as dependable tools for insight, performance, and sustainability.
