I enjoy building intelligent systems to tackle complex problems. To this end, I have specialized in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) and I have worked with computer vision, graph machine learning, generative models, and reinforcement learning. 

Recently I graduated from [Polythechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en), earning a Master's degree in *Data Science and Engineering*, which is part of a double degree program with the French university [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/home).

I am currently working at [CERN openlab](https://openlab.cern/) as a Fellow for Artificial Intelligence. Here I am co-leading a task of [interTwin project](https://www.intertwin.eu/), an EC project focused at developing a framework for advanced AI workflows in science. In addition to managing the work plan, I am deeply involved in the effort of scaling PyTorch and TensorFlow workflows to large scale computing infrastructure (such as HPC systems), also providing out-of-the-box hyper-parameter optimization capabilities through Ray Tune.

My long-term career goal is to participate in the development of useful, safe, and democratic AI, joining the best research-oriented companies -- like [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), to mention a few. Moreover, I am open to PhD positions which could give me the chance to bring outstanding contributions to the development of AI.
