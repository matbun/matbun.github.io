I enjoy building intelligent systems to tackle complex problems. My expertise lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), with hands-on experience in computer vision, graph machine learning, generative models, and reinforcement learning.

I earned a Master's degree in *Data Science and Engineering* from the [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en) as part of a double-degree program with [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/home) in France.

Currently, I am a Fellow for Artificial Intelligence at [CERN openlab](https://openlab-wp.web.cern.ch/), where I co-lead a task within the [interTwin](https://www.intertwin.eu/) project. Our team is developing [itwinai](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/itwinai), a framework for scalable AI workflows in scientific computing. My work focuses on scaling PyTorch and TensorFlow workflows for high-performance computing (HPC) environments while integrating advanced hyperparameter optimization with Ray Tune.

I am passionate about contributing to the development of AI that is impactful, safe, and widely accessible. My long-term goal is to advance AI research and applications in organizations that align with these principles.
