I have recently graduated from [Polythechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en), earning a Master's degree in *Data Science and Engineering*, which is part of a double degree program with the French university [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/home).

I am currently working in the Huawei's [AI4Sec](https://ai4sec.net/) team, part of the Munich Research Center, as a Cyber-security Data Scientist.
