I enjoy building intelligent systems to tackle complex problems. To this end, I have specialized in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) and I have worked with computer vision, graph machine learning, generative models, and reinforcement learning. 

Recently I graduated from [Polythechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en), earning a Master's degree in *Data Science and Engineering*, which is part of a double degree program with the French university [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/home).

I am currently working in Huawei's [AI4Sec](https://ai4sec.net/) team, part of the Munich Research Center, as a Cyber-security Data Scientist.

My long-term career goal is to participate in the development of useful, safe, and democratic AI, joining the best research-oriented companies -- like [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), to mention a few. Therefore, I am currently looking for a PhD position that could give me the chance to bring outstanding contributions to the development of AI.
