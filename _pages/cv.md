  * Co-leading task of [interTwin project](https://www.intertwin.eu/) concerning the development of a framework for advanced AI workflows in science
  * Scaling of PyTorch and TensorFlow workflows to large scale computing infrastructure (such as HPC systems)
  * Scaling of hyper-parameter optimization to HPC systems through Ray Tune.
  * Project management and main designer of the developed framework
  * Recruiting, mentoring and supervision (e.g., students)
  * Organization of events, such as [CERN openlab summer lectures 2023](https://indico.cern.ch/category/16988/)

* **Cyber-security Data scientist**, Jun 2022 - Dec 2022, *Huawei, Munich, Germany*   
  Machine Learning-based binary code analysis: research on Machine Learning-based binary code similarity methods;
implemented feature engineering methods for disassembled binary code; maintained end-to-end AI workflows for
binary code embedding via language models, and control-flow graph embedding via Graph Neural Networs (GNNs);
developed Python APIs to allow the integration of pre-trained ML workflows in a malware detection product.

* **Research Intern**, Sep 2021 - Feb 2022, *Huawei, Munich, Germany*    
  Analyzed the shortcomings of modern malware analysis techniques; Proposed an improvement to
dynamic malware analysis, leveraging Artificial Intelligence’s capability to deal with complex tasks;
Transformed binary code extracted from executable binaries into embedding vectors;
Implemented a working PoC based on Reinforcement Learning.

* **Big Data Analyst Intern**, Mar 2019 - Jun 2019, *Technology Reply, Turin, Italy*  
  Extracted unstructured textual information from bank transfers, collected from heterogeneous
sources using Spark; Analyzed text with data exploration/visualization approaches; Preprocessed
and transformed text into a numerical format, using NLP document embedding techniques;
Implemented clustering methods for semi-supervised class discovery; Developed rule-based and
machine learning (ML) based classifiers for bank transactions; Assessed models according to KPIs
defined in agreement with the team; Organized transactions in an OWL ontology for semantic
queries aimed at user profiling.


Research projects
======
* **Energy-based models (EBM)**, EURECOM Semester project, Mar 2021 – Jun 2021  
Performed a theoretical study of EBM and comparison with other deep generative models such as
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs); Compared different Markov chain (MCMC) sampling methods
from learned data distribution (Langevin dynamics, SGHMC); Successfully implemented a working
model, fully compliant with mathematical theory.
* **Graph Convolutional Networks for anomaly detection in financial graphs**, Partnership
EURECOM-ORACLE Semester project, Oct 2020 - Mar 2021  
Analyzed the main pitfalls of anomaly detection applied to financial graphs; Performed a
theoretical analysis of the current state of the art of Graph Convolutional Networks; Implemented
and compared methods for scalable processing on huge transaction graphs.
